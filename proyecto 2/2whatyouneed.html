                You're hypnotised, can't see the signs
                I'd like to help you, but I think it's too late
                Made up your mind, and now you're blind
                I guess it's easier than making mistakes
                Don't ask me why to roll your eyes at the answer
                You want a fight, but I won't bite on the bait
                And I'm not tryna change your eyes, so don't panic
                'Cause I'm not selling
                So don't tell me what I can see
                'Cause we both know it's you, not me
                You don't want this, but it's what you need
                And you'll see it when you believe
                You'll see it, you'll see it
                You'll see it when you believe
                You'll see it, you'll see it
                And you'll see it when you believe
                Give me a break 'cause I can't take
                Another second, you're a fucking headache
                I ain't got time to change your mind
                How can I move you when you're stuck in your ways?
                Don't ask me why to roll your eyes at the answer
                You want a fight, but I won't bite on the bait
                And I'm not tryna change your eyes, so don't panic
                I'm just saying, no, I'm just saying
                Don't come crawling back to me when you break down
                'Cause you dug yourself into this hole all by yourself
                Don't come crawling back to me when you break down
                You can find somebody else
                So don't tell me what I can't see
                'Cause we both know it's you, not me
                You don't want this, but it's what you need
                And you'll see it when you believe
                Don't tell me what I can't see
                'Cause we both know it's you, not me
                You don't want this, but it's what you need
                And you'll see it when you believe
                You'll see it, you'll see it
                You'll see it when you believe
                You'll see it, you'll see it
                And you'll see it when you believe
                Yeah, hell yeah
                You make me wanna slit my wrists and play in my own blood
                Yeah, hell yeah
                You make me wanna kill myself just for the fucking fun
                Yeah, hell yeah
                You make me wanna slit my wrists and play in my own blood
                Yeah, hell yeah
                You make me wanna kill myself just for the fucking fun
                So don't tell me what I can't see
                'Cause we both know it's you, not me
                You don't want this, but it's what you need
                And you'll see it when you believe
                And you'll see it when you believe
